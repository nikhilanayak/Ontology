# Project status — 2026-10-02

## Objective

Reconstruct anonymous NFL player trajectories in field coordinates from authenticated All-22 film, align independent camera presentations to nflverse play-by-play, and evaluate the result against Big Data Bowl (BDB) tracking. The pipeline is fail-closed: uncertain source grouping, alignment, calibration, coverage, or cross-angle agreement must remain reviewable rather than being published as a confident result.

Do not run the full season yet. The immediate objective is to improve and validate the bounded Bills-Rams pilot without trading away spatial track quality for identity continuity.

## Current state

- Current actual local HEAD: `ae4a84798189c3390a3923d593fc58f49a9cb35a` (`ae4a847 Separate spatial observations from durable identities`).
- Commit `ae4a847` was deployed. The latest known local commit sequence is through `ae4a847`; future agents must re-check `git rev-parse HEAD` because Git may have advanced after this handoff.
- Full test suite: **51 tests passing**.
- Implemented: semantic field calibration, keyframed field tracking, crowd gating, role-aware tracking, camera-angle scale gating, tracklet relinking, identity evaluation, 64-dimensional ResNet18 appearance embeddings, and separation of spatial observations from durable identity evaluation.
- The conservative tracklet relinker accepted **zero** joins on clips `0005`, `0278`, and `0295`; do not loosen its gates without an identity-metric improvement. This is currently a fail-closed capability, not a demonstrated quality gain.

## Architecture

1. The authenticated local Chrome/CDP collector discovers and validates All-22 HLS film, then streams the signed manifest over SSH stdin so `ffmpeg` writes directly to production.
2. The Python `all22` CLI stores game, clip, play, calibration, action-window, and artifact metadata; nflverse supplies structured play-by-play and BDB supplies evaluation truth.
3. Shot-centric detection uses a frozen Torchvision Faster R-CNN person detector. The current detector also emits ImageNet ResNet18 64d appearance embeddings.
4. Semantic number/yard-line calibration and keyframes map bottom-center contacts into the 120 x 53.333 yard field. Field-space tracking uses crowd, role, angle-scale, and relinking gates.
5. Spatial observations are now separated from durable identities. Repeated presentations are paired/aligned, then a separate identity evaluator measures matching quality against BDB.
6. The FastAPI viewer/API supports calibration, action review, alignment audit, and trajectory inspection.

## Paths and pilot data

- Local repository: `/Users/nnayak/FootballProject`
- Remote production repository: `/home/nikhil/fast/Ontology`
- Remote runtime/caches: `/home/nikhil/fast/Ontology/.runtime` via `source scripts/production-env.sh`
- Private generated inputs/outputs: repository-local `downloads/` and `data/` on the corresponding machine; both are ignored and must not be committed.
- Pilot: `bills-at-rams-2022-reg-1`
- BDB game ID: `2022090800`
- Imported Week 1 BDB table: **7,104,700 rows**, of which **417,772** belong to the target game.

## Evaluation history

These files are private, ignored evaluation artifacts under `data/`; record their summaries here but never commit the artifacts themselves.

| Run | Artifact | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-embedding identity baseline | `data/bdb-audited-evaluation-identities.json` | median purity `0.46335`; switches/100 `30.247` |
| 64d embedding, same evaluator | `data/bdb-audited-evaluation-embed64.json` | purity `0.4948`; switches/100 `28.8862`; refined error `2.66625 yd`; coverage `0.6638` |
| Latest separated evaluator, 18 sources | `data/bdb-audited-evaluation-embed64-separated.json` | raw error `5.2657 yd`; coverage `0.76317`; refined error `2.92556 yd`; purity `0.48576`; switches/100 `29.8966` |

The latest separated-evaluator result is **not spatially comparable** to the two earlier runs because the evaluator and observation/identity separation changed. Do not characterize its raw/refined spatial movement as a regression or improvement without an apples-to-apples rerun.

Selected latest per-source results:

| Source | Purity | Switches/100 | Fragmentation | Refined error (yd) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `0005` | `0.4165` | `26.60` | `6.55` | `5.3649` |
| `0278` | `0.54915` | `20.85` | `4.05` | `6.8855` |
| `0295` | `0.41793` | `37.25` | `11.13` | `5.6641` |

## Immediate next work

1. Tune embedding association on a small explicit clip set without losing good spatial tracks. Treat identity purity/switches and spatial error/coverage as separate paired outcomes.
2. Formalize an apples-to-apples evaluation protocol: freeze the source list, detections, calibration inputs, frame/time window, BDB matching, and evaluator version; rerun baselines through that same evaluator.
3. Improve field-boundary estimation and homography robustness, especially on the three weak example sources above.
4. Validate changes on additional bounded clips only after the explicit pilot clips improve or reveal a stable tradeoff.
5. Keep all detection/reconstruction work bounded (`--clip-id` preferred, otherwise a small `--limit`). Do **not** start a full-game or full-season run.

Canonical test, deployment, bounded experiment, and server-restart commands are maintained in `AGENTS.md`. Update this file immediately after the next experiment or deployment with the exact commit, command, source set, artifact path, and metrics.
